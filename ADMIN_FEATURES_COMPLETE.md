### 👤 2. Logged-In User Onboarding Skip

**Problem Solved**: Users who were already logged in had to go through account creation again when selecting a new role.

**Solution Implemented**:
- All 4 onboarding forms now detect existing sessions
- **New Users**: Full flow (Account Creation → Questionnaire → Email Verification)
- **Logged-In Users**: Skip straight to questionnaire (Step 2)
- After completion:
  - New users → Email verification screen
  - Existing users → Dashboard redirect

**Updated Forms**:
- ✅ `ProjectDeveloperForm.tsx`
- ✅ `TechnologyDeveloperForm.tsx`
- ✅ `CreditBuyerForm.tsx`
- ✅ `PartnerForm.tsx`

## 📁 New Database Tables

### `user_invites`
Tracks admin-sent user invitations.

**Columns**:
- `id` - Primary key
- `email` - Invitee email address
- `role` - Assigned role (PROJECT_DEVELOPER | TECHNOLOGY_DEVELOPER | CREDIT_BUYER | PARTNER)
- `message` - Personal note from admin
- `invited_by` - Admin email who sent invite
- `status` - pending | accepted | expired
- `created_at` - Timestamp
- `accepted_at` - Timestamp (nullable)
- `expires_at` - Auto-set to 7 days from creation

**RLS Policies**:
- Admins can view all invites
- Admins can create invites
- Users can view their own invite by email

**Functions**:
- `expire_old_invites()` - Auto-marks invites as expired after 7 days

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Step 1: Run SQL Migration (Supabase)
```sql
-- Copy and paste this file in Supabase SQL Editor:
supabase/migrations/COPY_PASTE_009_user_invites.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Admin Access
Your email (`tyler@malamalabs.com`) should already be in the `admin_users` table from migration `003_create_admin_role.sql`.

If not, run:
```sql
INSERT INTO public.admin_users (email, added_by)
VALUES ('tyler@malamalabs.com', 'manual_setup')
ON CONFLICT (email) DO NOTHING;
```

### Step 3: Test the Features

1. **Navigate to Admin Dashboard**:
   - Go to `/admin` on your site
   - Sign in if not already logged in
   - Verify you see all 4 tabs

2. **Test Users Tab**:
   - Search for users
   - Filter by role
   - View user details
   - (Optional) Test delete on a test user

3. **Test Images Tab**:
   - Upload a profile image from your user dashboard
   - Navigate back to `/admin` → Images tab
   - Verify image appears
   - Test View and Delete actions

4. **Test Invite Tab**:
   - Enter an email address
   - Select a role
   - Add a message
   - Click "Send Invitation"
   - Check for success message

5. **Test Logged-In Onboarding**:
   - While logged in, navigate to `/onboarding/v2`
   - Select a different role than your current one
   - Verify you skip straight to the questionnaire
   - Complete the form
   - Verify you're redirected to dashboard (no email verification screen)

3. Build invitation history viewer with status tracking
