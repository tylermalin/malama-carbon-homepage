# MĀLAMA LABS
## Universal dMRV Infrastructure on Cardano
### Catalyst Fund 15 Proposal

---

## Funding Request

**₳495,000** | **9 Months** | **6 Milestones**

**Category:** ReFi Infrastructure & Compliance Tooling

**Lead Entity:** Mālama Labs Inc. (Delaware C-Corp)

**Website:** https://malamacarbon.com

**Previous Catalyst:** Fund 12 — Delivered & Closed ✓

---

## Vision

### Building Universal, AI-Powered dMRV

**Every verified tonne of carbon removal:**
- Measured with precision
- Proven with standards
- Tokenized on Cardano
- Retired with transparency

**The Problem:** Legacy verification takes 12–24 months

**The Solution:** dMRV compresses timelines to weeks

**The Impact:** Cardano becomes the settlement layer for high-integrity climate assets

---

## The Problem We're Solving

### Three Critical Barriers

**1. Verification Delays**
- 12–24 months stall developer revenue
- Buyers lose confidence
- Billions in climate value stranded

**2. Multi-Registry Complexity**
- Small/mid-sized projects face overwhelming costs
- Fragmented systems limit access

**3. Poor Interoperability**
- Disconnected data systems
- Limited liquidity
- Broken trust chains

**Result:** High-impact projects cannot scale

---

## Our Solution: Universal dMRV

### Four Integrated Layers

**Data & Sensing**
- IoT + satellite ingestion
- Land, ocean, and industrial projects

**AI Verification Engine**
- ML-based anomaly detection
- ISO 14064-2 aligned
- Mass-balance validation

**Tokenization on Cardano**
- LC02 → VC02 → Retired
- Native assets + eUTXO

**Compliance Adapters**
- Puro.earth API integration
- Isometric protocol support
- Audit synchronization

---

## Why Cardano? Technical Rationale

### Three Strategic Advantages

**1. eUTXO & Native Assets**
- Immutable provenance
- Deterministic state
- MRV-linked tokens

**2. Hydra Layer 2**
- Isomorphic state channels
- Low-latency IoT processing
- High-throughput sensor streams
- Checkpoint to L1 for finality

**3. Cost & Security**
- Low transaction fees
- Auditable by design
- DePIN-ready infrastructure

**Interpretation:** Process frequent readings off-chain, commit verified summaries to L1

---

## Traction & Validation

### Proven Track Record

**Fund 12 Delivery ✓**
- "The Mālama Project: Oracle Concept for Hawaiʻi Environmental Data"
- Milestones accepted and closed out (2024)
